# Heart-Disease-prediction-Using-ML algorithm and web interface

Machine learning is extensively applied in various industries, including healthcare, where it plays a crucial role in predicting diseases like locomotor disorders and heart diseases. Early detection of heart disease is vital, as it is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. By predicting heart disease in advance, machine learning can offer valuable insights to doctors, aiding them in personalized diagnosis and treatment plans.

This project focuses on heart disease prediction using four popular machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). A comprehensive dataset of patient records, encompassing demographic, clinical, and laboratory features such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, was utilized for this purpose.

The application of these machine learning algorithms to the dataset resulted in a high prediction accuracy of 89% for heart disease risk. Additionally, a web user interface was developed, enabling users to input their medical data and receive a heart disease risk prediction. This interface can assist healthcare professionals in quickly assessing a patient's risk and can also empower patients to monitor their own health and make informed decisions.

The project concludes that machine learning models can substantially enhance heart disease risk prediction, providing clinicians with effective tools for preventive interventions.
